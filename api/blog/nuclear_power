the following answer when asked what blog he is most proud of in an

\u003Cp\u003E\u201cWe did a campaign for nuclear power in the late
\u201970s, at a time when it was not popular to talk about nuclear
power. Mike Hughes and I did full-page newspaper ads [with] a picture of
a power plant, then a huge, huge headline at the top that simply said,
\u2018Boo.\u2019 Then we had another one, a double-truck newspaper ad,
that was solid black with a little copy line in the middle that said,
\u2018Click.\u2019 The point was that this is what will happen if we
don\u2019t have nuclear power. It was controversial, but it was
absolutely great stuff.\u201d\u003C\/p\u003E \u003Cp\u003E\u2014Harry
